npm install --global @gridsome/cli

# cd into the project directory

## Forestry (Content Management)

This project has been pre-configured to work with Forestry, just import your repository âœ¨
Any changes you make will be commited back to the repo, and deployed if you're using Netlify.

## Deploy with Netlify

Import your site in Netlify

1. Create a new site in Netlify and import your repository.
2. Set the build command to: `gridsome build`
3. Set the publish directory to: `dist`

That's it, now your site gets deployed automatically on `git push` or when saving documents from Forestry.
